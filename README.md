# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe in C.

I wanted to work on my C coding so I made a command line version of Tic Tac Toe for 1-2 players.

Single player mode has an option for easy and hard mode "AI" opponent. It is impossible to win against on hard mode as the AI will always make the most optimal move. Easy mode has some variability in if the AI chooses a correct move or just a random square so it should be a lot easier to win.
